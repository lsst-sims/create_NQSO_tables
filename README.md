# create_NQSO_tables
Code contributed by @rjassef to create tables used to calculate number densities of QSOs

The original repository for this is https://github.com/rjassef/rubin_sim (but I didn't want to include the creation of the data tables in rubin_sim, so it's held here.)

We generated a new table using the new LSST filter (which can be found here: https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/data/rubin/sim-data/rubin_sim_data/). Additionally, in this process, we also considered IGM absorption by using the model from Inoue et al. (2014).
